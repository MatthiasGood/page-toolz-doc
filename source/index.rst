*******
Problem
*******
As an administrator of a smaller website or web-application you have to provide a form after an initial user login to
gather further information about the user (address, bank data, ...).
Furthermore you want to inform your user base about your new features every other month.

The handling of these 'announcements' gets more and more troublesome as you have to keep track of which user has
already seen which 'announcements' and what's the time horizon of these individual 'announcements'.

********
Solution
********
The Anounz App takes care of all these tedious tasks.

Not only does Anounz keep track of all the announcements and its recipients, but you also get some helpful insights
into the announcement - recipients relationship.

To see how it works, check out the User Documentation.
